/Today I learned, Emacs version. Inspired by [[https://github.com/jbranchaud/til][jbranchaud/til]]./

+ *org-contacts*

  You can use [[https://julien.danjou.info/projects/emacs-packages#org-contacts][org-contacts]] from org-contrib to manage contacts. This is really
  neat considering it integrates with gnus.

+ *mpc*

  There is a pretty nifty [[https://www.musicpd.org/][mpd]] client built into Emacs. Use ~M-x mpc~.

/Today I learned, Emacs version. Inspired by [[https://github.com/jbranchaud/til][jbranchaud/til]]./

+ *data structures*

  I never went beyond list. Knew about [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Association-Lists.html][alists]], but didn't know there are
  [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Hash-Tables.html][hash tables]] and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Vectors.html][vectors]] too. In case you are working with key-value pairs in
  either hash table or alist form, try [[https://github.com/Wilfred/ht.el][ht.el]].

+ *org-contacts*

  You can use [[https://julien.danjou.info/projects/emacs-packages#org-contacts][org-contacts]] from org-contrib to manage contacts. This is really
  neat considering it integrates with gnus.

+ *mpc*

  There is a pretty nifty [[https://www.musicpd.org/][mpd]] client built into Emacs. Use ~M-x mpc~.
